* Bread
  Bread is an extensible text-editor. It takes inspiration from those that came before it, namely (Neo)Vim and Emacs.

** Baking Bread
   To build Bread, you need the following dependencies:
   - MessagePack
   - Asio

   To build Rye, you need the following dependencies:
   - Qt5

   To build the Bread tests, you need the following dependencies:
   - GTest
   
   To build the whole repo, do the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/bread-editor/bread
  cd bread
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "Ninja" # Note: Ninja can be swapped with any other build system you'd like, but I personally use Ninja
#+END_SRC
   
   This will result in Bread, Rye, and the Bread tests being built in build/bin.
