** UI Notes
   Using QGraphicsScene-esque widget to draw most layout elements. Elements are mostly just text with different backgrounds, borders, font-colors, etc.

* Plugin API
  Goal: Allow plugins to be written in mostly any language by providing a clean API for developers to use. Officially supported plugin language will most likely be Lua.
* Data Structures
  Use a gap-buffer for right now. If that proves to not be efficient enough, switch to ropes
* Tests
