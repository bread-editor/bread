* Design Goals
** General
   - Code should be clean, readable, and well-documented
   - Working with Bread should be enjoyable; the editor should not fight you
** Editing
   - Include useful functions for editing
   - Make the default editing bindings sensical and ergonomic
** Back End
   - The back-end should be efficient and well-documented
   - Include functions that are useful to developers of plugins by default
** GUI
   - Allow for images, multiple fonts, and anything else to be displayed
   - Be consistent across platforms
   - Extensible enough to have a plugin change it completely
* Tasks
  - [ ] Implement the server
  - [ ] Get basic text-editing functions working
  - [ ] Implement a basic GUI (maybe terminal based)
  - [ ] Make functions that take ranges, positions, or anything like that safe if the range or position is out of bounds
